The two example sequences present in this package are in FASTA file format.

The first one is from S.cerevisiae and is the sequence of the GCV3 gene on chromosome 1.
It is a protein coding gene which encodes for subunit H of glycine decarboxylase.
The FASTA was downloaded from NCBI database.
NCBI Reference Sequence: NC_001133.9, Gene ID: 851254

The second is from K.lactis, it is the sequence of a protein coding gene on chromosome A.
The protein is uncharacterized, but it is similar to GCV3 so it could be a putative homolog.
The FASTA was downloaded from NCBI database.
